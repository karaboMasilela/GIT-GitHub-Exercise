
I go by the names Karabo Mpendulo Masilela. I was born in Johannesburg South. As a young kid, like many others , had a variety of passions, at some point i wanted to be a doctor, 
then a lawyer then a hacker lol , so one could say it was a confusing predicament because they are so different. However i developed love for Comercial business
in my mid-high school years which then led me to do Business, Accounting and Economics as my primary subjects.

I went on to do my Bachelors degree at UKZN in Bachelor of Commerce, where i majored in Information Management Systems which was like great thing for me because i was able to fuse my passions into one when then led me here to LSW,
 where i hope to grow as a developer .
